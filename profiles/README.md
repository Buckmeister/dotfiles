## Using Profiles

### Interactive Wizard
The easiest way to use profiles is through the interactive wizard:

```bash
cd ~/.config/dotfiles
./wizard
```

The wizard will prompt you to select a profile early in the setup process. If you choose a profile, it will pre-fill your configuration settings (which you can still modify).

### Profile Manager
You can also manage profiles directly using the profile manager:

```bash
# List all available profiles
./profile list

# Show detailed information about a profile
./profile show standard

# Apply a profile (run its post-install scripts)
./profile apply work

# Check currently active profile
./profile current
```

### Manual Selection
If you want to manually configure based on a profile, simply read the YAML file:

```bash
cat profiles/standard.yaml
```

Then use those settings when running setup scripts.

## Profile Structure

Each profile is defined in a YAML file with the following structure:

```yaml
name: profile_name
description: "Brief description of the profile"
emoji: "üéØ"

post_install_scripts:
  - vim-setup.zsh
  - language-servers.zsh
  - fonts.zsh

packages:
  manifest: profiles/manifests/profile-packages.yaml
  level: recommended  # minimal, recommended, or full

settings:
  editor: nvim
  shell: zsh
  theme: onedark

dev_languages:
  - python
  - javascript
  - rust

features:
  fonts: true
  toolchains: false
  cargo_packages: false
```

### Package Manifests

**New in 2025**: Each profile now references a declarative package manifest that defines exactly which packages to install. This makes profiles fully reproducible and cross-platform.

- **Location**: `profiles/manifests/`
- **Format**: YAML manifest following the universal package management schema
- **Benefit**: One profile = complete, reproducible environment (packages + post-install scripts)

When you apply a profile with `./profile apply <name>`, it will:
1. Install all packages from the manifest (via `install_from_manifest`)
2. Run all post-install scripts
3. Save the profile as current

## Creating Custom Profiles

You can create your own custom profile:

1. Copy an existing profile as a template:
   ```bash
   cp profiles/standard.yaml profiles/custom.yaml
   ```

2. Edit the profile to your liking:
   ```bash
   nvim profiles/custom.yaml
   ```

3. Use your custom profile:
   ```bash
   ./profile show custom
   ./profile apply custom
   ```

## Profile Settings

### Package Levels

## Integration with Wizard

The wizard integrates profiles seamlessly:

1. **Step 3** of the wizard prompts you to select a profile
2. If you choose a profile, it pre-fills settings (editor, shell, theme, languages, etc.)
3. You can still modify any pre-filled setting in subsequent steps
4. Your chosen profile is saved to `~/.config/dotfiles/personal.env`
5. At completion, the wizard offers to generate a **custom package manifest** based on your choices
6. The wizard shows you how to apply your profile or install from your custom manifest

### Custom Manifest Generation

The wizard can generate a personalized package manifest (new feature!):

```bash
./bin/wizard.zsh
# ‚Üí Follow prompts and select preferences
# ‚Üí At completion, choose "yes" to generate custom manifest
# ‚Üí Creates: ~/.config/dotfiles/my-packages.yaml
```

Your custom manifest includes:
- Core essentials (git, curl, shell)
- Your chosen editor (nvim, vim, emacs)
- Modern CLI tools (ripgrep, fd, bat, etc.) based on package level
- Language-specific packages based on your dev_languages selection
- Optional tools if you selected "full" package level

Install your custom manifest anytime:
```bash
install_from_manifest -i ~/.config/dotfiles/my-packages.yaml
```

## FAQ

**Q: Can I change my profile after running the wizard?**
A: Yes! Just run `./profile apply <profile>` to switch.

**Q: Do I have to choose a profile?**
A: No. You can select "None" in the wizard and configure everything manually.

**Q: Can I modify a profile after applying it?**
A: Yes. Profile settings are just starting points. Edit `~/.config/dotfiles/personal.env` anytime.

**Q: What if I want some features from multiple profiles?**
A: Create a custom profile that combines the features you want!

**Q: Will applying a profile overwrite my existing setup?**
A: Profiles only run specified post-install scripts. Your existing symlinks and configurations remain intact.

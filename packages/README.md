# Universal Package Management System

**Status**: ‚úÖ Core Implementation Complete - Integrated with Profiles
**Latest**: Manifests, installer, and profile integration fully operational

---

## üìñ Overview

This directory contains the foundation for a **universal, cross-platform package management system** that enables defining packages once and installing them anywhere.

### The Vision

Instead of maintaining separate package lists for each platform:
- ‚ùå `Brewfile` for macOS
- ‚ùå `apt-packages.txt` for Ubuntu
- ‚ùå `choco-packages.txt` for Windows

Maintain **one universal manifest** that works everywhere:
- ‚úÖ `packages.yaml` - One manifest, any platform

### Core Philosophy

1. **Write Once, Run Anywhere**: Define packages once, install on any OS
2. **Intelligent Mapping**: Automatic translation to platform-specific package names
3. **Flexible Priorities**: Required, recommended, optional filtering
4. **Rich Metadata**: Documentation built into the manifest
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new package managers and platforms

## üìÅ Directory Structure

```
packages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SCHEMA.md           # Complete schema documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base.yaml           # Curated base manifest (~50 packages)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example.yaml        # Full-featured example (coming soon)
```

### File Purposes

**SCHEMA.md**
- Complete schema documentation
- Field reference with examples
- Best practices and conventions
- 200+ lines of comprehensive guidance

**base.yaml**
- Curated list of ~50 essential packages
- Cross-platform mappings for common tools
- Organized by category and priority
- Production-ready starting point

**example.yaml** (planned)
- Demonstrates all schema features
- Complex configurations and edge cases
- Learning resource for advanced usage

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Review the Base Manifest

```bash
cat packages/base.yaml
```

This shows ~50 carefully curated packages with cross-platform mappings.

### 2. Understand the Schema

```bash
cat packages/SCHEMA.md
```

Complete documentation of the YAML format, fields, and conventions.

### 3. Plan Your Custom Manifest

Copy `base.yaml` as a starting point:
```bash
cp packages/base.yaml ~/.local/share/dotfiles/packages.yaml
```

Edit to match your needs:
- Remove packages you don't need
- Add packages specific to your workflow
- Adjust priorities (required/recommended/optional)
- Add platform restrictions

### 4. Install Packages

**Available now!** Package management tools are fully implemented:

```bash
# Install from a manifest
install_from_manifest -i ~/.config/dotfiles/my-packages.yaml

# Install from profile manifests
install_from_manifest -i profiles/manifests/standard-packages.yaml

# See all options
install_from_manifest --help
```

Additional tools:
- `generate_package_manifest` - Export from your current system (available)
- `sync_packages` - Keep manifest synchronized (available)

---

## üì¶ Package Manifest Structure

### Minimal Example

```yaml
version: "1.0"

packages:
  - id: neovim
    install:
      brew: neovim
      apt: neovim
```

### Realistic Example

```yaml
version: "1.0"

metadata:
  name: "My Dev Environment"
  author: "Thomas"

settings:
  parallel_install: true

packages:
  - id: neovim
    name: "Neovim"
    description: "Modern Vim-based editor"
    category: editor
    priority: required
    platforms: [macos, linux, windows]
    install:
      brew: neovim
      apt: neovim
      choco: neovim
      winget: Neovim.Neovim
    alternatives:
      - method: cargo
        package: neovim
    dependencies: [git, curl]
```

See **SCHEMA.md** for complete field documentation.

## üóÇÔ∏è Categories

Packages are organized into logical categories:

- `editor` - Text editors (Neovim, VS Code)
- `shell` - Shells and shell utilities (zsh, bash)
- `search` - Search tools (ripgrep, fd, fzf)
- `git` - Git and version control (git, gh, delta)

- `development` - Dev tools (LSP servers, formatters)
- `utilities` - System utilities (htop, jq, tree)
- `container` - Docker, Kubernetes
- `font` - Nerd Fonts and typefaces

Categories enable filtered installation:
```bash
# Future command:
install_from_manifest --category editor,git
```

---

## üéöÔ∏è Priority Levels

Each package has a priority level:

### `required`
- **Essential** packages needed for basic functionality
- Always installed by default
- Examples: git, curl, neovim, zsh

### `recommended`
- **Commonly used** packages most developers want
- Installed by default unless explicitly excluded
- Examples: ripgrep, bat, tmux, nodejs

### `optional`
- **Specialized** packages for specific needs
- User must explicitly opt-in
- Examples: Docker, Firefox, VS Code, fonts

Filter by priority:
```bash
# Future commands:
install_from_manifest --required-only
install_from_manifest --skip-optional
```

---

## üåç Platform Support

### Supported Platforms

- `macos` - macOS
- `linux` - Any Linux distribution
- `ubuntu` - Ubuntu specifically
- `debian` - Debian specifically
- `fedora` - Fedora specifically
- `arch` - Arch Linux specifically
- `windows` - Windows
- `wsl` - Windows Subsystem for Linux

### Platform Filtering

Packages can restrict to specific platforms:

```yaml
- id: hammerspoon
  platforms: [macos]  # macOS only
  install:
    brew_cask: hammerspoon
```

The installer automatically skips packages incompatible with current platform.

---

## üîÑ Planned Workflow

### Generate Manifest from Current System

```bash
# Export currently installed packages to manifest
generate_package_manifest

# Output: ~/.local/share/dotfiles/packages.yaml

# Merge with existing manifest (smart update)
generate_package_manifest --merge

# Interactive mode (prompts for metadata)
generate_package_manifest --interactive
```

### Install from Manifest on New System

```bash
# Install all required + recommended packages
install_from_manifest

# Install only required packages
install_from_manifest --required-only

# Install specific categories
install_from_manifest --category editor,git,search

# Dry run (preview what would be installed)
install_from_manifest --dry-run

# Use custom manifest
install_from_manifest --input ~/my-packages.yaml
```

### Keep Manifest Synchronized

```bash
# Add newly installed packages to manifest
sync_packages --add

# Remove uninstalled packages from manifest
sync_packages --remove

# Update all metadata
sync_packages --update

# Commit and push changes
sync_packages --push
```

## üéì Learning Resources

### Getting Started
1. Read **SCHEMA.md** for complete field reference
2. Study **base.yaml** for real examples
3. Copy base.yaml and customize for your needs

### Advanced Usage
- Platform-specific packages
- Alternative installation methods
- Post-install commands
- Dependency management
- Repository management

### Contributing
- Test manifests on different platforms
- Report bugs and edge cases
- Suggest new package mappings
- Contribute to package database

---

## üí° Design Decisions

### Why YAML?

- **Human-readable**: Easy to read and edit
- **Comments**: Document package choices
- **Structure**: Hierarchical and flexible
- **Standard**: Well-supported, many parsers
- **Git-friendly**: Clean diffs

### Why Not Just Use Brewfile?

Brewfile is great for macOS, but:
- ‚ùå macOS-only (doesn't help on Linux/Windows)
- ‚ùå No package metadata or descriptions
- ‚ùå No priority levels or categories
- ‚ùå No cross-platform mappings
- ‚ùå Limited to Homebrew packages

Universal manifest:
- ‚úÖ Works on any platform
- ‚úÖ Rich metadata and documentation
- ‚úÖ Flexible filtering and organization
- ‚úÖ Maps to any package manager
- ‚úÖ Includes system + language packages

### File Locations

**Base manifest** (version controlled):
- Location: `~/.config/dotfiles/packages/base.yaml`
- Purpose: Curated starting point in git repo
- Usage: Template for new manifests

**User manifest** (not version controlled):
- Location: `~/.local/share/dotfiles/packages.yaml`
- Purpose: User's custom package list
- Usage: Generated from system or customized from base

Scripts will support both locations and can merge them.

## ü§ù Integration with Dotfiles

This package management system integrates seamlessly with the dotfiles:

### Profile Integration (NEW!)

**Profiles now reference package manifests!** This creates fully reproducible environments:

```bash
# Apply a profile (installs packages + runs post-install scripts)
./bin/profile_manager.zsh apply standard

# Behind the scenes:
# 1. Installs packages from profiles/manifests/standard-packages.yaml
# 2. Runs post-install scripts (vim-setup, language-servers, etc.)
# 3. Saves profile as current
```

Each profile has a corresponding manifest:
- `profiles/minimal.yaml` ‚Üí `profiles/manifests/minimal-packages.yaml` (10 packages)
- `profiles/standard.yaml` ‚Üí `profiles/manifests/standard-packages.yaml` (25 packages)
- `profiles/full.yaml` ‚Üí `profiles/manifests/full-packages.yaml` (7 additional packages)
- `profiles/work.yaml` ‚Üí `profiles/manifests/work-packages.yaml` (13 packages)
- `profiles/personal.yaml` ‚Üí `profiles/manifests/personal-packages.yaml` (18 packages)

See `profiles/README.md` for complete profile documentation.

### Wizard Integration (NEW!)

The interactive wizard can now generate custom manifests:

```bash
./bin/wizard.zsh
# ‚Üí Select languages (python, rust, go, javascript)
# ‚Üí Choose editor (nvim, vim, emacs)
# ‚Üí Set package level (minimal, recommended, full)
# ‚Üí At completion: generates ~/.config/dotfiles/my-packages.yaml
```

Your custom manifest includes:
- Core essentials (git, curl, shell)
- Your chosen editor
- Modern CLI tools (if recommended/full level)
- Language-specific packages (python@3.12, ipython, rust, gopls, node, npm, etc.)
- Optional dev tools (if full level)

Install anytime:
```bash
install_from_manifest -i ~/.config/dotfiles/my-packages.yaml
```

### Shared Libraries

Package scripts use the same UI libraries:
- `bin/lib/colors.zsh` - OneDark color scheme
- `bin/lib/ui.zsh` - Progress bars and headers
- `bin/lib/utils.zsh` - OS detection and helpers
- `bin/lib/greetings.zsh` - Friendly messages

### Consistent Experience

- Same look and feel as other dotfiles tools
- Same friendly, encouraging tone
- Same cross-platform approach
- Same attention to detail
